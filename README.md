# ResNet50 Transfer Learning for Melanoma Skin Cancer

## Description

This project demonstrates the power of transfer learning in medical image classification. I used a pre-trained ResNet50 model, fine-tuned on a dataset of melanoma skin cancer images, to classify skin lesions as either benign or malignant.


## Dataset

I used the Melanoma Skin Cancer Dataset from Kaggle, which contains over 10,000 dermoscopic images of skin lesions, labeled for benign and malignant melanoma. The dataset was split into training (80%) and validation (20%). 

## Results

Only 5 epochs and small subset of images were used to fine-tune the model to demonstrate the power of transfer learning. Nonetheless, the model performed very well with Epoch 5 having a Training Loss of 0.0796, an Training Accuracy of 0.9675, a Validation Loss of 0.3359, and a Validation Accuracy of 0.9237.
